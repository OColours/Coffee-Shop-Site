# Coffee Shop Website

Welcome to the Coffee Shop Website project! This is the repository for my bootcamp coffee shop project code and resources for a multi-page website designed to help a new local coffee shop establish its digital presence before opening.

### Key Features

- **Landing Page**: The main page providing essential information about the coffee shop.
- **Menu Page**: Detailed offerings of the coffee shop's products.
